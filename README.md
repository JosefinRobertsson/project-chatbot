# Project Name

Replace this readme with your own information about your project.

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

First project of the bootcamp. Make a chatbot with any theme that you can give input and that replies to you. Main focus is the javascript.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

I planned information gathering well and read up a lot on suggested resources before I even started looking at the code. I hit a lot of snags because the resources might be good if you know a bit about Javascript, but this was my first go. With a lot of googling, trial and error, looking at code that works and asking around I got it going though. 

I made the project small because it's hard to plan time when you don't know what lies ahead. If I had more time I would add more questions and options, fix the problems with sound, change the size values and make it more responsive, style it better... And so on.
